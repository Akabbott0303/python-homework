## PyBank
The PyBank file contains a Python script that is used to analyze financial records for a company using an imported CSV file.  The output results in a text file that contains the number of months in the dataset; the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the period of time; the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the period of time; the greatest increase in profits over the period of time; and the greatest decrease in losses over the entire period.
